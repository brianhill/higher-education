# The Liberal Arts

## Ends

In the medieval European university the seven liberal arts were grammar, rhetoric, and logic (the trivium) and geometry, arithmetic, music, and astronomy (the quadrivium).

A problem with the liberal arts today is that they are viewed as separate or even in opposition to the sciences. This is odd, because logic,
geometry, arithmetic, and astronomy are all easy to place within mathematics and science. Since it is a grave error to separate the mathematics
and science from the liberal arts, we won't entertain the modern usage wherein a "School of Liberal Arts" common exists separately from a "School of Science"" within a college.

## Means

### Courses

The division of learning into courses, the sum of which is refered to as a curriculum.

### Cultivating Intensity in Learning

To use a modern colloquialism, masters consisently have a beast mode. They vary a great deal how much of their time they spend
in beast mode, but this intense state is essential to their progress. Is there a beast mode within you? Do you want to cultivate it?

Do you think you have to force yourself into beast mode by just pushing yourself harder? If yes, you probably don't have a sustainable
way of cultivating intensity.

The following four ideas help you cultivate intensity. You are not looking to force a dragon into doing what you want. You are summoning
a dragon.

#### Mastery

Cultivate a desire for mastery. An awareness that mastery is your goal, and that sacrifice and choices are required.

#### Identity

Identify as a practioner. Be careful of wanting what you see as the endpoint of practice. A practice is not an end. It is a means. You will
always practice. You will never get there. Identify as a practitioner may mean recognizing that real practioners have doubt about
their choices and identity.

#### Difficulty

Embrace difficulty. Repeat-until-fail when weightlifting is a good example of difficulty. If you are forcing yourself
to find diffculty, this is not sustainable. You must recognize that difficulty is part of an intense practice, that it is what
makes you better, and that the feeling of difficulty is desirable.

#### Peers and Mentors

Most of your peers will be doing what seems to them to be "enough." Since humans take cues from their peers,
it is easy for you to assume that that is enough for you too. If soccer practice is two hours and everyone heads off to 
relax and socialize, what stops you from practicing for another hour? This doesn't mean you have to be practicing all the time.
You can still be smart and efficient. But definitely do not take queues of what is enough by average peers.

You may not have the good fortune of having a mentor. Observe masters in all disciplines, and not just academic disciplines. Observe artists,
athletes, and entrepreneurs. Understand the common features of their mastery.
